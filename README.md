# Open Relay

Free and open source fonts from Kreative Software:

  * [Constructium](http://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/constructium.shtml)
    * Constructium is a fork of SIL Gentium designed specifically to support constructed scripts as encoded in the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry. It is ideal for mixed Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, IPA, and conlang text in web sites and documents.
  * [Fairfax](http://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfax.shtml)
    * Fairfax is a 6x12 bitmap font for terminals, text editors, IDEs, etc. It supports many scripts and a large number of Unicode blocks as well as constructed scripts as encoded in the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry, pseudographics and semigraphics, and tons of private use characters. It has been superceded by Fairfax HD but is still maintained.
  * [Fairfax HD](http://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfaxhd.shtml)
    * Fairfax HD is a halfwidth scalable monospace font for terminals, text editors, IDEs, etc. It supports many scripts and a large number of Unicode blocks as well as constructed scripts as encoded in the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry, pseudographics and semigraphics, and tons of private use characters.

## Notice

* This repository is only about fonts. It is not about Unicode character properties, character names, UCSUR proposals, etc.
* **This is not the place to propose new scripts or characters for the UCSUR.** Please look for the About link at the bottom of the UCSUR page.
* This is not the place to add or update character properties for private use characters. You want [openrelay-tools](https://github.com/kreativekorp/openrelay-tools) instead.
* Issues requesting a particular script are welcome, to give me an idea of which scripts users of these fonts want the most. Issues requesting all the scripts these fonts do not yet support are not welcome as they are neither necessary nor helpful.
* This repository will eventually disappear one day, replaced with individual repositories for each font.
